	<h2>AST 3162 - Modelling Analysis</h2>
	<p>
		Tue/Thu 4:00 - 5:15PM in Back lab

	<h3>Course</h3>
	<p align="justify">The goal of this course is to get you familiar with numerical tools used
		in scientific modelling. By the time you finish it you should be able to
		comfortably and independently approach a variety of
		astrophysical problems. The course is assignment oriented meaning you
		will receive a new problem each week and be given a week to solve it
		and write a report. In general, Tuesday session will be used for
		introducing new problems and giving you the details on how to approach
		a particular problem. On Thursdays, we'll be reviewing and discussing
		the work you have completed. Solving problems will in all cases
		require you to write a short computer program. The choice of the
		programming language will not be enforced, but it is highly recommended
		that you use python programming language. In recent years it has
		become a standard choice among astronomers. You are encouraged to
		discuss and develop your solutions with your colleagues but final reports must be
		produced completely individually.</p>

	<h3>Software/reports</h3>
	<p align="justify">To successfully solve problems you will be required to use different
		numerical methods. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you are
		advised to use already written and well-tested methods (random
		generators, integrators, FFT and plotting routines etc.) that you can
		find in various libraries. (This is another reason to stick to python
		since there is a huge number of very useful python modules available.)
		Your reports must be written electronically. Preferred typesetting
		package, at least among scientist, is LaTeX but you are not obligated
		to use it. You must however submit you report in PDF format with a
		specific file name: &#37;02d_vuusername.pdf. If your name is John Doe
		and you are submitting a report for the 4th assignment, you should name
		your PDF file as 04_jdoe.pdf. Also, reports must be submitted
		<i>before</i> the deadline.</p>	
	
	<h3>Grading</h3>
	<p align="justify">Each assignment will be graded on the scale from 0 to 100, depending on
		the quality, innovativeness, and completeness of your work. Assignments
		submitted late cannot get more than half of available points, so it is
		very important that you submit them in time. If an illness or another
		serious reason prevents you from completing the work, you must notify
		me in advance (<i>before </i> the submission deadline). Final graded
		will be generated from the (possibly weighted) average of all assignment
		grades by following university's grading scale.</p>
	
	<h3>Academic integrity</h3>
	<p align="justify">Cheating, copying, or any other violations of the Code of 
		ethics will be taken very seriously and will be strictly reported. Just don't do it.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3>Books/Papers</h3>
	<p align="justify">The course will not follow any book in particular but here 
		is an incomplete list of references that you might find useful at some point:</p>
